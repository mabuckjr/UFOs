# UFO's
#### Tools used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a website about UFO's with a dynamic table that displayed data about UFO sightings. This table was to have multiple filters so that users could filter through the table by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The final webpage was a visually appealing site that UFO conspiracists from all over could enjoy.

## Results 
Someone who wanted to use the website would first read the opening paragraph toward the top of the website. Then, they would scroll down to see a table that has around 100 different recorded UFO sightings. That would be too much to sort through, so I made the table dyanmic by adding filters. The user can utilize up to 5 filters to sift down the results based on what they want to read about. These filters are located on the left side as they scroll down. The possible filters are:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape of UFO

They can use as many or as few of the filters as is needed. The filter is case-sensitive, so all entries must be in lowercase and should not have any symbols (other than the date). After someone enters an element into one of the boxes that fits the appropriate syntax and criteria, the data will be automatically filtered once they click outside of the box. If they would like to clear the table and start over, they would need to erase each of the boxes and reload the page. Below is a photo of what the search may look like for the average desktop user:

This webpage is simple and overall easy for the future users to navigate and use. They should be able to handle it without too many issues, even though it may not be as smooth as Facebook, Reddit, or another website that they are more familiar with.
